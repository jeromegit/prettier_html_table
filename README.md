# prettier_html_table -  Simple way to create prettier HTML table using Python
This package was inspired by https://github.com/sbi-rviot/ph_table.

I decided to rewrite the whole thing to allow for more flexibility and work around some of the limitations 
without losing any of the original simplicity. In the end, I only kept the nice color schemes.
